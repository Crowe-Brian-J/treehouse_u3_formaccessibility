Principles of an Accessible Form

* Avoid unnecessary questions
* Minimize questions per stream
* Provide context clues
  - Chunking - breaking long form into steps, increases completion rate
    -- Remind user of form purpose
    -- Clearly label the current step
    -- How many tasks have been completed
* Group related questions
* Use clear input labels vs placeholder text
  - Mobile labels should be above, not beside
* Make focus indicators obvious
* Help users spot and correct errors
